- Healthcare equity analysis across demographic groups
- Drug utilization patterns and adverse event correlation

**Technical Implementation**:
- Build aggregation services for population-level analytics
- Create clustering algorithms for outbreak detection
- Implement equity metrics calculations
- Build interactive dashboard using existing Flask API

**Differentiation**: Moves beyond individual patient care to system-level optimization that Palantir specializes in.

### 5. **Explainable AI for Clinical Decisions** 🧠
**Goal**: Enhance Claude integration with interpretability features

**Explainability Features**:
- Evidence-based reasoning chains for each recommendation
- Confidence intervals with uncertainty quantification
- Alternative treatment pathway exploration
- Integration with medical literature citations (PubMed API)

**Technical Implementation**:
- Extend clinical_analysis_service.py with explanation generation
- Add uncertainty quantification to confidence scores
- Integrate PubMed API for literature evidence
- Create reasoning visualization components

**Innovation**: Addresses the critical "black box" problem in medical AI, crucial for clinical adoption.

- Demonstrates advanced analytics capabilities
- Shows understanding of clinical workflows

### Phase 3: Enterprise (Long-term - 6 weeks)
**Priority**: Enhancement #3 (Compliance) and #4 (Population Health)
- Demonstrates enterprise-readiness
- Shows understanding of healthcare system challenges
- Positions for government/healthcare sector applications

## Technical Architecture Considerations

### Database Extensions
```sql

    dataset_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    source_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    data_type TEXT NOT NULL,
    last_updated TIMESTAMP,
    metadata JSONB
);

CREATE TABLE audit_trail (
    audit_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id TEXT,
    action_type TEXT NOT NULL,
    resource_id TEXT,
    timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    details JSONB
);

CREATE TABLE prediction_models (
    model_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    model_type TEXT NOT NULL,
    version TEXT NOT NULL,
    training_data JSONB,
    performance_metrics JSONB,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### API Extensions
```python
# New route categories to implement
/api/integration/     # Multi-modal data integration
/api/prediction/      # Treatment outcome prediction
/api/compliance/      # Audit and compliance features
/api/population/      # Population health analytics
/api/explanation/     # Explainable AI features
